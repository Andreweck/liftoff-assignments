FEATURES:
* User accounts: These will be used to store the tablature files and associate it with the author when it is shared publicly. A user will, of course, need to log into an account in order to use this app. 
* Tablature paper: In this app, a user will be able to create tablature, which can be used for their own personal use, sent to another user, or share to their profile.
* Messaging: Users will be able to send each other messages through this application. They can also message each other their pieces of work
* Audio recording: A user will be able to record and upload it, or they can upload an audio file that they have on their computer. 


Overview:


 The purpose of this app is a social media page centered around musical ideas. Each user can create a piece of music through a tablature or an audio file, and publish, message, or store it privately on the app. Users will be able to message each other feedback on each other’s pieces, or even, add to the piece if they are given permission by the author.




Some of the technology used for this will include:
* C#
* .net
* Javascript
* Entity Framework


Some things that I would need to learn are:
* How to store a javascript string into an html form. I will need to use this to store a “key” string for each of the notes used in the tab.
* I will need to reliably learn how to use Entity framework.
* I will need to learn how to create a drag and drop function to use to create the tablature. 
* How to record and play an audio file through the app and how to mix audio files through the app.
